MicroBlog

A small microblogging server that was made as an introduction to flask. I followed a tutorial to create this and the website is linked in description of the repository. 

The project is incomplete. I am able to run a basic server with serveral pages and a user database, but many parts of remain incomplete.

The project is based on flask and served as an introduction to web development. More details about the project can be found the tutorial.

to run: ./run.py
